This benchmark runs the actual Hermes funded executor against an already deployed disposable Cardano devnet with open transfer channels. It uses the production Gateway, Hermes signing policy and trusted Ogmios evaluation and submission. Every run starts with a newly funded backlog and ends after Hermes records all send inclusions. It then checks that Kupo reports every admitted output as spent.

Use a dedicated magic-42 runtime inside `.deployment-smoke`. Retain its `compose.json`, `runtime/genesis-shelley.json`, `handler.json`, pinned `hermes.toml` and public fixture key store. The Gateway must use this deployment and all endpoints must refer to this runtime. `benchmark-ports.json` supplies `DEVKIT_OGMIOS_PORT` and `DEVKIT_KUPO_PORT`. `benchmark-offset.json` supplies the historical disposable clock offset as `{"offset": -123456}`. Keep `FAKETIME_DONT_FAKE_MONOTONIC=1` for Hermes so durations use real elapsed time.

Split the signer fee inputs and fund the published test user once:

```sh
deno run -A --config cardano/offchain/deno.json \
  scripts/benchmark/prepare-packet-executor-backlog.ts \
  "$RUNTIME" wallets
```

Initialize the lanes outside the timed comparison:

```sh
python3 scripts/benchmark/packet-executor.py \
  --runtime "$RUNTIME" --hermes "$HERMES_BINARY" \
  --channels channel-0 channel-1 channel-2 channel-3 \
  --per-channel 1 --warmup
```

Compare a 16-intent backlog at widths one, two and four in opposite orders:

```sh
python3 scripts/benchmark/packet-executor.py \
  --runtime "$RUNTIME" --hermes "$HERMES_BINARY" \
  --channels channel-0 channel-1 channel-2 channel-3 \
  --per-channel 4 --widths 1 2 4 4 2 1
```

Receipts, complete Hermes logs, configs and `report.json` remain in a new directory inside the runtime. Stop any other relayer for this deployment before each run. The driver stops only its own Hermes process. A failed admission or drain retains evidence and stops the comparison. Reconcile retained transactions before retrying. The fee funding helper refuses to overwrite its receipt.

The timer includes Hermes startup and source batch building, signing and inclusion. Channel creation, fee funding and intent admission happen before it starts. Increasing lane occupancy can change builder costs across runs. Actual block timing and indexer delays can vary. Report the individual runs and compare nearby pairs. These runs do not measure delivery on the counterparty, acknowledgements, pruning or sustained traffic after a lane fills.
