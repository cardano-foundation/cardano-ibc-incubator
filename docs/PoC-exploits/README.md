# Proof of Concept Attack Vectors

This directory contains proof of concept (PoC) attack vectors and griefing scenarios against the Cardano IBC Bridge. These PoCs are not limited to exploits that result in actual loss of user funds, they also cover scenarios related to how IBC trustlessness is expected to function in practice.

For example, PoCs involving a malicious relayer are considered valid, even though such attacks may be impractical in a production deployment where the relayer and gateway infrastructure are operated by a trusted party. The goal here is to document and understand the theoretical limitations of the current implementation, which is valuable for forming informed trust assumptions and guiding future improvements to the bridge architecture.

PoCs that do not actually work are also valuable as they help corroborate the security of the implementation. Attempts to impersonate the relayer or perform arbitrary modifications to IBC host state, for instance, are useful to prove that such attacks are not possible under the current design.

## Some Valuable Edge Cases

The following scenarios represent valuable edge cases worth exploring:

- **Failed/cancelled transactions inducing state changes**: Can a transaction that fails or is cancelled still cause partial or unintended state changes on either chain?
- **Griefing via repeated bad transactions**: Can an attacker spam the system with invalid transactions to cause denial of service, exhaust resources, or degrade performance?
- **Race conditions in packet relay**: Can timing attacks or front-running allow manipulation of packet ordering or acknowledgements?
- **Stale or replayed proofs**: Can outdated Mithril proofs or transaction data be replayed to cause unintended behavior?
- **Timeout manipulation**: Can an attacker manipulate timeout parameters to cause funds to be locked or packets to be dropped?
- **Malicious counterparty chain**: What damage can a compromised or malicious Cosmos chain inflict on Cardano-side state?
- **UTxO contention attacks**: Can an attacker intentionally create UTxO contention to block or delay legitimate IBC operations?
- **Partial state corruption**: Can selective failure of multi-step operations leave the bridge in an inconsistent state?
- **Transaction body hash verification**: Are there any code paths where we fail to verify that the transaction body CBOR actually hashes to the claimed tx hash? Could this be abused to forge or substitute transaction data?
- **Host state NFT manipulation**: Can the host state NFT be moved or manipulated in ways that are not properly constrained by the validators? For example, can it be moved away from the expected script address, have its datum arbitrarily modified, or be burned/duplicated?
- **Unverified off-chain computations**: A general pattern to scrutinize is anything the relayer does or the gateway computes/submits that is not verified by any on-chain mechanism. In a trustless bridge, all critical state transitions should be validated on-chain; any reliance on off-chain honesty represents a trust assumption that should be documented or eliminated.
