#### 10.2 Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements are divided into two categories, depending on whether the infrastructure is deployed to run the full IBC application stack or only relayers.

##### 10.2.1 Full IBC Application Stack

To run the full IBC application stack, including the IBC applications, the infrastructure must support the following components:

- **IBC Application**
- **IBC Explorer**
- **Subql Multichain Indexer**
- **Hermes Relayer**

**Minimum Hardware Requirements:**

- **CPU:** Minimum 8 cores
- **RAM:** 16 GB or higher
- **Storage:** NVMe SSD with 500 GB capacity for fast read/write access, especially for the indexer and blockchain data storage.
- **Network:** Minimum 500 Mbps network interface for communication between blockchain networks and efficient relaying.
- **Backup Systems:** Regular backup solutions, including off-site backups for critical data.
- **Load Balancer:** To distribute incoming traffic and handle application-level load.

##### 10.2.2 Relayer Only Setup

For an infrastructure setup that only runs relayers, minimal resources are required since the relayer’s primary role is message transmission between blockchains. The following components will be running in this setup:

- **Go-Relayer**

**Minimum Hardware Requirements:**

- **CPU:** 8 cores
- **RAM:** 16 GB or higher
- **Storage:** SSD with 500 GB capacity
- **Network:** Minimum 500 Mbps network speed
- **Backup Systems:** Basic backup systems to ensure continuity in case of system failure.
