# Porting Notes

## Current Target

This module targets Cosmos SDK `v0.53.0` and `ibc-go/v8.7.0`.

## Other Cosmos SDK v8 Targets

Cosmos SDK chains must compile and register custom IBC light clients in the chain binary. A relayer cannot dynamically install this module on a running chain.

This document assumes the target chain uses `ibc-go/v8`. The exact port still depends on the target chain's Cosmos SDK, CometBFT, Go, and any fork-specific replacements.

## Expected Porting Work

1. Identify the target chain's Cosmos SDK, `ibc-go/v8`, CometBFT, Go, and module replacement versions.
2. Create a compatibility branch or module variant for that dependency set.
3. Keep the protobuf package and type URLs aligned with `/ibc.lightclients.probabilistic.v1.*`.
4. Wire the app by registering the concrete types with the interface registry and adding the probabilistic light client app module in the target chain's module list, following the local light-client module shape used by that chain.
5. Ensure the IBC client params allow `08-cardano-probabilistic`; on restricted networks this requires governance or genesis/config changes in addition to the binary change.
6. Re-run client creation after a binary with this module is deployed. Without that chain upgrade, nodes will continue rejecting `/ibc.lightclients.probabilistic.v1.ClientState` as an unresolved type URL.
